# Game Developing Girls
Hey there! 

We're a small German speaking team from Switzerland and Germany that has just recently started making games together. 

All of us are represented by a flower: 

- Allium for our lovely lady for all the fine details and level design.
- Poppies for the tech genius at work cruising through Unity.
- Gerberas for the lead character designer and the one responsible for anything alive.
- Lycorises for our newcomer and lovely artist.

Check out our newest game we made for the Historically Accurate Game Jam 7, The Tale of Mother Lü!  .｡.:*☆
